Notes for the [Python For Everybody](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python) course offered by the University of Michigan on Coursera
- I'm currently working through the course and plan on adding my capstone project here when it's done
- I use jupyter notebook to write the notes
  - If loaded in vscode, should come with a table of contents automatically

***

File labelled 'Extras' has text files to practice handling files with python
- Pictures added in notes are also included in 'Extras'
